I'll help you install this Chrome extension. Let me fetch the repository to see the installation instructions.Based on the README, here's how to install GSD (Get Shit Done) for Antigravity:

## Installation Steps

For Windows (PowerShell):
In powershell Terminal:

# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project-name

# Clone the GSD template to ur project folder
git clone https://github.com/toonight/get-shit-done-for-antigravity.git gsd-template

# Copy the files to your project / Run these after cloning in the powershell 
Copy-Item -Recurse gsd-template\.agent .\
Copy-Item -Recurse gsd-template\.gemini .\
Copy-Item -Recurse gsd-template\.gsd .\

# Clean up
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force gsd-template
```

## After Installation

Once installed, run `/new-project` in Antigravity (side agent) and follow the prompts to initialize your project.

This will set up:
- `.agent/` - 21 slash commands and 8 agent specializations
- `.gemini/` - Rules enforcement
- `.gsd/` - Your project specs, roadmap, state, and documentation

The system uses a spec-driven approach where you describe what you want, and the AI builds it with proper context engineering and atomic git commits.
